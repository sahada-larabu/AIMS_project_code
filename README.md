This project is in completion of my MSc in Mathematical Sciences studies at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, South Africa
This project compares the Capital Asset Pricing Model with an Artificial Neural Network approach using linear regression and Multi-Layer Percetron(MLP).
The comparison was done using the stock returns data pertaining to Apple Inc.(AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2019.
